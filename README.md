# Hang_Man_Game

I have made a simple game named Hang Man.

Instructions of the game are :- 

1) You have to guess a word from the months of a year.
2) After you guessed the month then type any letter of the month and press enter.
3) If the typed letter matches the alphabet of that month then you will be saved from hanging to the death and your life will not be deducted.
4) But if you guessed the wrong letter than the ife will be deducted by '1'.
5) After you have finished with your lives then you will be hanged by the jailer till the death :(
6) If you have guessed and typed the right letters of the month name then you will be free and ready to live your life happily!!
7) You will be getting '3' lives per game.
